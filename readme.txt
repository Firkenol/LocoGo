LocoGo Code README
Author: Latif Tabanli
This is the code for LocoGo, a travel optimization technology that takes in the airport that you want to go to and the time of your flight and returns your entire trip's timeline along with assistance on how to get there. We are currently in the early stages of our development, but are working tirelessly to bring our customers the intended results. We got inspiration from https://github.com/taitcha/tsa-mashup for the algorithm, and you will see some of their code here despite not being used only for us to get ideas for our own algorithm.
